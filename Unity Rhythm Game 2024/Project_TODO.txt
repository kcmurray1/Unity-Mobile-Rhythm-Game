1) Experiment with the passing method signatures as parameters
	- Line 173 GameBoard.cs: PlayEffect may not be necessary
	- Maybe adjust JudgementButton Initialize() parameter SoundManager to Action 

2) Add StartSpawner() in NoteSpawner class
	- Currently, creating an instance will start the spawner. May want to treat 
    Initialize() as the setup method and then trigger StartSpawner from the GameManager
